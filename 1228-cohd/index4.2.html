            Speaker: Professor Homi Bhabha<br/>
            Anne F. Rothenberg Professor of the Humanities, and the Director of the Humanities Center at Harvard University<br/>
            Professor Bhabha has been, for over two decades, a leading figure in contemporary postcolonial studies and in the investigation of identity and alterity. He has developed key concepts in the field, including hybridity, mimicry, difference, and ambivalence, all framed as ways in which oppressed peoples resist and have resisted colonial power.
